 You constantly seep blood from phantom wounds; even though your flesh remains unbroken, you bleed. The bleeding is fairly slight, but incessant, costing you an extra blood point each evening (marked off just before dawn). The 2-trait version of this flaw gives you a one-trait penalty on Social challenges; and the 4-trait version if this flaw indicates that you bleed from your eye-sockets. This obviously makes it almost impossible to travel within human society unveiled, and very much disturbs other Cainites increasing the penalty for Social challenges to two traits, and causing a one-trait penalty to visual perception challenges besides.

-Your bite transmits the madness of your clan. Whenever you feed from a mortal, the power of the Kiss holds them in place as normal. However, your mortal prey may gain a temporary derangement from the transmission of blood. The madness lasts for a week or so for each blood trait taken. Malkavians with this Flaw are often the ones you hear about infesting asylums. It's the most low-key place for them to feed. When a Malkavian with this Flaw feeds, she makes a static test with the Narrator or Storyteller to determine if a derangement transfers into the victim.</P></

+== Updates 3/20/2009 ==
+The long awaited return of the Stolen Hours website! There's little new here yet but the updates will be coming. It's only been two years in the making right?
 
+- Game dates are now shown with an embedded Google Calendar so there's a chance they will actually be updated properly!
+- The directions page now includes an embedded Google Map to assist in finding our site.
+- Removed the clan merits and flaws section since it was nearly a set of reprints. Later version will have page references and any necessary clarifications.
